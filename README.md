cred web interface
=====
cred-web is a javascript interface that displays data and other things using the
API exposed by a [cred-server web application](https://github.com/Tehnix/cred-server "cred-server repository").

To use the application, first configure it to use your API key and set the host
for the cred-server, which the javascript interface will talk to.
